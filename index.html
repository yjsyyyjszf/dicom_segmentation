                Figure 3: Viewing a sample slice with various adjustments to contrast resolution
                The next step was to fix the ‘greyed out’ image and start normalizing the data, 
                by adjusting the values of the numpy array and obtaining images with higher 
                contrast and detail. Looking back at the statistics calculated for the scans in 
                Figure 2, we can see that there is a drastic range in values, with a minimum of -1316,
                 maximum of 1687, and significant standard deviation of 454.706. 
                 Through a series of trial and error, using NumPy’s clip function, I reduced the 
                 range in values of the numpy array to produce images with higher contrast resolution 
                 and greater detail. After finding a suitable range to confine the values to and adjusting
                  the contrast of the images, the next step was starting the actual segmentation process.
